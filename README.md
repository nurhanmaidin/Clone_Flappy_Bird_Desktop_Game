# Flappy Bird Clone – C++ Game Development Project

This project is a recreation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game developed using **C++**.  
It was built to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental game programming concepts such as the game loop, physics simulation, collision detection, and real-time input handling.

The objective of the game is simple: control the bird, avoid pipes, and achieve the highest score possible.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my knowledge in:

- Real-time application development  
- Event-driven programming  
- Frame updates & rendering  
- Physics-based movement  
- Collision logic  
- Performance optimization  

It also reflects my ability to write structured, maintainable native code.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- The bird moves continuously forward.
- Gravity constantly pulls the bird downward.
- Player presses a key to make the bird jump.
- Pipes move toward the player.
- Collision with pipes or ground ends the game.
- Score increases as obstacles are passed.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🕹 Real-Time Controls
Keyboard input allows the player to keep the bird airborne.

### 🌍 Continuous Scrolling Environment
Obstacles move dynamically to simulate world movement.

### ⚙ Physics Simulation
Gravity and jump force create smooth motion.

### 🚧 Collision Detection
Game ends when player hits pipe or boundary.

### 🧮 Score Tracking
Points awarded based on survival and successful passes.

### 🔁 Game Restart
Ability to retry after losing.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

This project highlights understanding of:

- Game loop architecture  
- Time-based updates  
- Object movement  
- Hitbox logic  
- Random obstacle generation  
- State management  
- Rendering cycles  

---

## 🛠 Technology Used

- **C++**
- Standard libraries for logic & structures
- Graphics / rendering library (depending on implementation)
- Native execution environment

---

## 🚀 How To Run

### Compile
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o flappybird
```

### Run
```bash
./flappybird
```

*(Commands may vary depending on your graphics library or setup.)*

## 🎯 Player Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Space / Up Arrow | Jump |
| Restart key | Retry after game over |

---

## 🧩 Engineering Focus

Instead of just cloning visuals, the project focuses on building the mechanics behind the game:

- Consistent frame updates  
- Smooth motion  
- Fair collision boundaries  
- Replayability  

---

## 🎓 Project Background

This project was developed as part of my academic and personal learning journey to explore lower-level programming and real-time system design.

It complements my other software projects by demonstrating skills outside of web and mobile development.
